# nvim-select-buffer
Plugin for NeoVim to display and switch to a buffer. (also my first nvim plugin)

This plugin is not ready yet and is **NOT** usable. Still has a lot of work that must be done.

# Todo
- Complete the movement feature and select buffer feature
- Prepare the directory structure for 'packer' compatibility
- Clean the code and add some color to the display
