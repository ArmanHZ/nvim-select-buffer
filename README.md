# nvim-select-buffer
Plugin for NeoVim to display and switch to a buffer. (also my first nvim plugin)

This plugin is kinda usable as of now. The buffer selection works, but the plugin setup needs to be ready for normal use. I will be working on fixing these.

# Todo
- ~~Complete the movement feature and select buffer feature~~
- Add help menu below the Buffer text
- Prepare the directory structure for 'packer' compatibility
- Add a demo video for the repo
- Clean the code and add some color to the display
